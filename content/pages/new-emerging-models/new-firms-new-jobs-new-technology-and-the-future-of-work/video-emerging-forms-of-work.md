In the video below, Postdoctoral Fellow John McCarthy talks about new, technology-mediated work arrangements like Uber and TaskRabbit.com.

Corporations in the 1950s were intellectually and behaviorally conformist. There were steep pay inequalities based on race and gender, and white men were almost exclusively in charge. Although many of these problems persist today, pay gaps are decreasing, more women are in leadership roles, and more and more companies encourage creativity and individual expression.{{< /quiz_solution >}}{{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
