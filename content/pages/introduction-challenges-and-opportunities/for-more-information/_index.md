The above video, "Wealth Inequality in America," highlights the CEO-to-average-worker compensation ratio. You may have seen different ratios reported in the news or elsewhere.  The ratio cited in this video is from the AFL-CIO's [Executive Paywatch](https://aflcio.org/paywatch) website.

An example of a slightly different estimate of compensation ratio, from the Economic Policy Institute, can be found in the next video below.
